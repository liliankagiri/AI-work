## 🔁 Google Form Auto-Responder (n8n Workflow)

A no-code automation built with n8n that:

- Captures Google Form submissions (via Google Sheets)
- Extracts user email
- Sends a personalized confirmation email using Gmail

📁 File: [`googleform-automation.json`](./workflows/googleform-automation.json)

### 💡 Concepts:
- Reactive agent behavior (perceive → decide → act)
- Workflow automation
- Real-time user interaction

---

## 🎧 Audio to Text Conversion (Google Colab)

A notebook that takes an audio file (MP3 or WAV) and converts it into readable text using OpenAI Whisper.

📁 File: [`audio_transcription_colab.ipynb`](./audio-to-text/audio_transcription_colab.ipynb)

### 💡 Concepts:
- Speech recognition with Whisper
- Google Colab for lightweight AI experiments
- Real-world application: meeting notes, voice memos, and accessibility
